# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

TinyLLM takes security seriously and has implemented several measures to ensure safe operation:

### 🛡️ SafeTensors Integration
- **Secure Model Storage**: All neural models use SafeTensors format to prevent arbitrary code execution
- **Memory Safety**: SafeTensors provides zero-copy loading with validation
- **Integrity Checks**: Built-in tensor validation and corruption detection

### 👥 User Isolation
- **Separate Storage**: Each user's models are stored in isolated directories
- **Access Control**: Models are scoped to specific user IDs
- **Data Separation**: No cross-user data leakage

## 🐛 Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **Model Sources**: Only load models from trusted sources
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Environment**: Keep dependencies updated
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls in production

### For Developers
- **Code Review**: All changes go through security review
- **Dependencies**: Regularly update and audit dependencies
- **Testing**: Security testing is part of our CI/CD pipeline
- **Isolation**: Use containerization in production environments

## ⚠️ Known Security Considerations

### Model Safety
- **Training Data**: Users are responsible for ensuring training data is safe
- **Generated Content**: Models may generate inappropriate content
- **Bias**: Models may reflect biases present in training data

### File System Access
- **Model Storage**: TinyLLM reads/writes to the file system
- **Permissions**: Ensure appropriate file permissions
- **Path Traversal**: Input validation prevents directory traversal

### Memory Usage
- **Large Models**: Neural models can consume significant memory
- **Resource Limits**: Implement appropriate resource limits
- **DoS Prevention**: Consider rate limiting in public deployments

## 🛠️ Security Features

### ✅ Implemented
- **SafeTensors**: Secure model serialization format
- **Input Validation**: Parameter validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information leakage
- **User Isolation**: Separate model storage per user
- **Format Validation**: Model file format validation

### 🚧 Planned
- **Model Signing**: Digital signatures for model authenticity
- **Encryption**: Optional model encryption at rest
- **Audit Logging**: Security event logging
- **Access Tokens**: API access token system

## 🔍 Security Audits

### Internal Audits
- **Code Review**: All code changes reviewed for security
